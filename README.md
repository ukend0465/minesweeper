# Minesweeper

An open source implementation of the classic Minesweeper game.

## About the Game

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game that originated in the 1960s. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

### Game Rules

1. The game board consists of a grid of cells, some of which contain mines.
2. Players click on cells to reveal what's underneath.
3. If a cell containing a mine is revealed, the player loses the game.
4. If a cell not containing a mine is revealed, a digit appears indicating how many adjacent cells contain mines.
5. If no mines are adjacent, the cell is blank and all adjacent cells are automatically revealed.
6. The player uses this information to deduce the locations of mines.
7. The game is won when all non-mine cells are revealed.

## Features

- Multiple difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert)
- Custom board sizes
- Timer to track your speed
- First-click protection (first click is never a mine)
- Flag placement to mark potential mines

## Installation
