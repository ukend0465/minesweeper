# Minesweeper

An open source implementation of the classic Minesweeper game.

## About the Project

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game that originated in the 1960s. The objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

This implementation aims to provide:
- A clean and modern interface
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Time tracking and high scores
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Implementation Details

The game is built using standard web technologies:
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
- JavaScript for game logic

## How to Play

1. Click on a cell to reveal it
2. Numbers indicate how many mines are adjacent to that cell
3. Right-click to flag a suspected mine
4. Clear all non-mine cells to win

## Future Features

- Custom board sizes
- Themes
- First-click protection
- Question mark flags
